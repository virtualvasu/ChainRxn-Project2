# ChainConnect - Interact with the Blockchain

Welcome to **Project 2**! In this challenge, you will implement a very simple blockchain and make it interactive by building a frontend using React.

## ðŸš€ How to Participate

1. **Fork the repository**

2. **Clone your forked repository**

3. **Complete the backend**

   * Navigate to the backend directory:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   * Fill in the `TODO` comments in the files. The guiding structure is already in place.
   * Run the backend and ensure it functions as expected.

4. **Complete the frontend**

   * Navigate to the frontend directory:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   * Implement the missing logic in the `TODO` comments.
   * Make API calls to your running backend.

### ðŸŽ¯ Bonus

You are encouraged to:

* Revamp the architecture or design if you have a better idea.
* Build other simple apps that use the blockchain backend.

> **Note:** The goal here is not to build a full-featured blockchain, but to help you understand its core functioning. In **Project 3**, we will interact with a live Bitcoin node.

### âœ… Minimum Required Features


* **Blockchain Network**: Core structure with blocks linked by hashes to ensure integrity.
* **OOP Design**: Uses object-oriented principles with `Block` and `Chain` classes.
* **Immutability**: Data in a block can't be changed; every block depends on the previous one.
* **SHA256 Hashing**: Ensures data integrity and tamper-proof blocks.
* **API-Driven Backend**:

  * Add a new block
  * View the entire chain
  * Fetch the latest block
* **React Frontend**: UI to interact with the blockchain through APIs.


## ðŸ§ª API Endpoints

### POST `/addBlock`

Adds a new block.

* **Request Body**:

  ```json
  { "data": "Your data here" }
  ```
* **Response**: `200 OK` with the newly created block.

### GET `/getChain`

Returns the full blockchain.

* **Response**: JSON array of all blocks.

### GET `/getLatestBlock`

Returns the most recent block.

* **Response**: JSON object with latest block data.

Deadline for submission: **5th July' 25**

>**BONUS** marks will be awarded for any kind of unique thinking or cool side application related to the core concept of this project.
